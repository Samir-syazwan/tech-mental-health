                        <h2>Sleep Hours & Gaming</h2>
                        <p>Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining mental and emotional balance. However, extended
                            screen exposure particularly through gaming can significantly reduce sleep duration and
                            disrupt healthy sleep patterns.</p>
                        <p><strong>Gaming and Sleep Impact:</strong> Late-night gaming sessions often lead to delayed
                            bedtimes and reduced sleep quality. The stimulating nature of games and exposure to blue
                            light can interfere with melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep and leading to
                            fatigue and mood issues during the day.</p>
